# Code
- [ ] make it faster

- [ ] parts of the image seem to be cut off; rethink `cutoff` parameter
- [ ] make a gui
- [ ] parse function definition from command line
- [ ] change function from interface
- [ ] implement under manim
- [ ] more informative colorization
- [ ] implement Mandelbrot set
- [ ] visualize transformations of shapes on the complex plane

# Math
- [ ] investigate difference field (connection to diff eq?) [ ] divergence, curl of difference field?
- [ ] difference field vs gradient
- [ ] is there a useful notion of $f_{1 1/2}(z)$?
    - [ ] connection to the half derivative?
- [ ] find cycles
- [ ] analytic properties of $f$
- [ ] relation to newton iteration
- [ ] attractors and basins
- [ ] integer sequences (Fibonacci sequence, Collatz conjecture, etc.)
- [ ] why is $f(z) = z^2 [|z - 1| = 1]$ a cardioid?
